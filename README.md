# Advent of Code 2019

Running through Advent of Code 2019 in Python 3.8. Choosing Python for a few reasons:

* Wanting to play around with the new features - particularly the "walrus" operator (`:=`).
* Keeping myself up-to-speed with modern Python trends since I haven't used much of it lately at work.
* I'm have many days I'm taking off this month so I figured it was best to stick with a language I was familiar with.

## Conventions

* Everything is unit-tested against the examples provided. Pure TDD.
* Only Python code goes in the `aoc2019` folder. All puzzle input is saved in `fixtures`.
* Everything should be runnable as a module - e.g. `python -m aoc2019.day1.main`.
* Remember that your input is not necessarily going to match mine. That being said, `tests` will contain spoilers.
  Tread carefully.
